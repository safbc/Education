# Education

Welcome to the Springblock Education Repository. Here, you will find our research split into two categories: 

> 1) Theoretical papers intended for non-developers, business executives and other people just trying to wrap their heads around decentralized networks incentivized by cryptographic tokens.

> 2) Practical examples that developers can use as templates to get going. Obviously, all of our actual work has happened in the chain-spacific repos above this one, so feel free to poke around in there for any real world examples you might need. The examples provided here are meant specifically as templates to help kickstart your development on the future of value.

We value community and hope that you will feel free to submit a PR with any recommendations, additions, and examples of your own that you feel would be beneficial to the wider public.
